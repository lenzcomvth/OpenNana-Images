  "prompt": "Cinematic medium shot of a ruggedly handsome East Asian martial arts master, mid-30s, intense and focused piercing gaze, furrowed brows, distinctive groomed black beard and moustache, hair pulled back into a tight traditional topknot bun, skin texture showing realistic pores and subtle weathering. He is struck in a dynamic Tai Chi stance, right hand held near the chest in a vertical mudra, left hand thrust forward with palm open, generating a mystical swirling vortex of translucent wind energy and falling pink cherry blossom petals (sakura) that spirals around his forearm. Attire consists of layered traditional Hanfu robes in slate blue and textured grey linen, wide sleeves billowing dramatically in the coastal wind, dark waist sash, realistic fabric folds and creases. Background features a dramatic coastal cliffside, turbulent teal ocean waves crashing against jagged dark rocks, white sea foam, lines of blooming cherry blossom trees on the ridge, atmospheric depth of field. Lighting is soft and diffuse, overcast sky, cool cinematic color grading with vibrant pink accents, high contrast, photorealistic 8k, shot on Sony A7R IV, 85mm f/1.2 lens, epic Wuxia aesthetic, sharp focus, volumetric atmosphere.",
