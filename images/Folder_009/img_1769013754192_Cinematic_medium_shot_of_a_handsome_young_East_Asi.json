  "prompt": "Cinematic medium shot of a handsome young East Asian Wuxia swordsman standing calmly in a bamboo forest, exuding a restrained heroic aura reminiscent of a high-budget historical drama. Sharp and well-defined jawline, masculine facial structure, realistic skin texture with visible pores and a subtle natural sweat sheen, stoic and contemplative expression with a gentle yet piercing gaze that conveys inner strength and quiet resolve. Soft golden-hour side lighting sculpts the face, creating natural contrast and cinematic depth. He wears traditional coarse grey linen robes with rough, unpolished fabric texture, visible weave patterns, layered garments tied at the waist with a worn sash, realistic folds and creases suggesting long travel and battle-worn experience. Relaxed yet grounded posture, holding a sheathed sword with a wooden scabbard and fabric-wrapped hilt diagonally across the lower body, weathered hands with pronounced veins and calloused realism. Background features misty limestone karst mountains in the distance inspired by Guilin landscapes, bamboo leaves softly framing the foreground and midground, atmospheric depth with volumetric fog, warm sunset rim light outlining the silhouette, natural earthy color palette. Shot on Sony A7R IV, 85mm f/1.4 GM lens, shallow depth of field, creamy bokeh, subtle film grain, Kodak Portra 400 aesthetic, ultra-detailed, photorealistic, cinematic masterpiece, 8K resolution.",
