  "prompt": "A hyper-realistic cinematic medium shot of a distinguished middle-aged East Asian Daoist master, salt-and-pepper full beard, long dark hair pulled back into a messy traditional topknot with loose strands, intense focus and wisdom in his eyes, weathered skin texture. He is dressed in worn, coarse mustard-yellow linen Hanfu robes with heavy fabric folds and wide sleeves, a dark sash around the waist. He stands in a three-quarter profile, right hand raised with index and middle fingers extended in a precise mudra gesture, conjuring a streak of radiant, glowing golden Qi energy that cuts through the air. The background features ancient Chinese temple architecture with curved wooden eaves and intricate tiling, set against a backdrop of dramatic, misty karst mountains and a cloudy, overcast sky. Soft, diffused ambient lighting with warm volumetric rim lighting from the magic spell, shallow depth of field, bokeh effect, shot on Sony A7RIV with 85mm f/1.4 GM lens, high contrast, Wuxia film aesthetic, 8k resolution, highly detailed texture.",
