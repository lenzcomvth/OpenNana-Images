  "prompt": "A hyper-realistic, urban surreal masterpiece featuring the uploaded face as reference, portrayed as a miniature figure standing atop a colossal, spinning vinyl record in a dimly lit, smoky jazz lounge atmosphere. The subject is wearing a textured, vintage herringbone tweed vest over a crisp white roll-neck sweater, holding a humongous industrial mop to 'clean' the dust from the record's grooves. Shot with a Canon EOS R5 and a 100mm macro lens to emphasize the tactile ridges of the black vinyl and the microscopic dust particles floating in the volumetric lighting. The background features giant, blurred brass instruments and low-hanging Edison bulbs, creating creamy bokeh circles. Lighting is moody and cinematic, with a warm tungsten rim light outlining the subject's profile against the dark, glossy surface. Rendered in 8k resolution with Octane Render, utilizing raytracing for perfect reflections and subsurface scattering on the skin texture",
