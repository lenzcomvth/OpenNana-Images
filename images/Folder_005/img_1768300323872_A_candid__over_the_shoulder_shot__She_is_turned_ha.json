  "prompt": "A candid, over-the-shoulder shot. She is turned halfway toward the camera, her thin breath visible in the cold morning air. Her hair and facial features are preserved perfectly from the reference. The background features a misty, frozen lake with distant pines. Ambient light is dim and moody, with a soft glow reflecting off the snow onto her face. 100% face match, 50mm lens, film grain texture.",
