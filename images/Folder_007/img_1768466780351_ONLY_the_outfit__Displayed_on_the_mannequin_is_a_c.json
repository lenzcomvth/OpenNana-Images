  "prompt": "ONLY the outfit: Displayed on the mannequin is a coordinated three-piece ensemble consisting of casual loungewear and lingerie, accompanied by a single piece of jewelry.\n\n**Outerwear**\nThe outermost layer is a lightweight, long-sleeved cardigan in a soft, creamy off-white hue. The fabric exhibits a fine, vertical rib-knit texture, suggesting a soft cotton or modal blend. It features an open-front design without visible buttons or fasteners. The cuffs are finished with a denser, tighter ribbing, designed to hug the wrists or forearms.\n\n**Upper Lingerie**\nUnderneath the cardigan is a slate-grey bra characterized by a smooth, matte finish, indicative of a microfiber or jersey stretch fabric. The design features a plunging neckline with defined, curved cups. Distinct piping or seams run along the bottom curve of the cups for structural support. A tiny, singular white button serves as a decorative accent at the center gore.\n\n**Lower Lingerie**\nThe lower garment is a pair of panties in a matching slate-grey tone and smooth fabric texture. They feature a wide, elasticated waistband in a slightly lighter shade of grey. The waistband prominently displays the brand name \"CALVIN KLEIN\" in capitalized, white sans-serif lettering. The cut appears to be a hipster or brief style, offering moderate coverage.\n\n**Accessories**\nA delicate gold-tone necklace is draped around the neck area. It consists of a fine chain supporting a small, simple, circular gold pendant.. Photorealistic clothing, mannequin or flat lay on white studio background, extremely high detail, accurate fabric textures.",
