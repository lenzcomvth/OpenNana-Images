  "prompt": "A candid side-view 90s film photograph of a tattooed Vietnamese man in his mid-20s, leaning against a wooden window frame of a rural 'Nhà Lá'. He wears an open, light brown Ao Ba Ba tunic that reveals his detailed chest tattoos. His expression is contemplative and distant as he looks toward the dark garden outside. High-intensity point-and-shoot flash illuminates his profile against the deep interior shadows.",
