  "prompt": "ONLY the outfit: Here is a description of the outfit and accessories displayed as if on a mannequin:\n\n**The Top**\nThe primary garment is a crisp, long-sleeved button-down dress shirt in a bright, optical white. The fabric appears to be a smooth, high-thread-count cotton poplin or a cotton-blend, characterized by a matte finish with very subtle, soft highlights where the fabric curves.\n\n*   **Construction and Fit:** The shirt is heavily tailored with a slim, form-fitting silhouette. Vertical princess seams or darts run down the front of the bodice, creating a structured shape that tapers significantly at the waist. The material creates natural, soft tension creases radiating from the buttons and around the elbow joints, indicating a fabric with slight stiffness but good pliability.\n*   **Neckline and Closure:** The shirt features a classic, sharp-pointed collar that stands stiffly. The center front placket is unbuttoned from the collar down to the mid-chest, creating a deep, plunging V-shaped opening. Below this opening, the shirt is fastened with small, round, pearlescent white buttons that blend into the fabric.\n*   **Sleeves:** The sleeves are full-length, ending in standard cuffs that appear slightly pushed up or bunched at the forearms, creating horizontal folding in the fabric.\n\n**The Bottoms and Accessories**\n*   **Belt/Waistband:** At the natural waistline, the shirt is tucked into a lower garment. Visible is a wide, solid black band, likely a leather or faux-leather belt or a structured waistband. It has a smooth, matte texture devoid of visible stitching or patterns, providing a sharp, high-contrast boundary against the white shirting.. White background, mannequin or flat lay, high detail.",
