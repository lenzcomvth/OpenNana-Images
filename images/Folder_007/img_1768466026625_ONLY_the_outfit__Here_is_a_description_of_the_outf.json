  "prompt": "ONLY the outfit: Here is a description of the outfit presented as if displayed on a mannequin:\n\n**Upper Body: The Shirt**\nThe primary garment is a crisp, optic-white button-down shirt constructed from a smooth fabric, likely a fine-gauge cotton poplin or a cotton-spandex blend, given its slight sheen and ability to stretch. The material appears lightweight and semi-opaque, with subtle translucency.\n\n*   **Cut and Silhouette:** The shirt features a highly tailored, form-fitting cut designed to contour closely to the torso. Vertical princess seams or darts run from the mid-chest down to the hemline, enforcing a structured, hourglass shape.\n*   **Collar and Placket:** It has a standard, sharp-pointed spread collar. A central front placket runs down the midline, fastened with small, round, pearlescent white buttons. The top several buttons are left unfastened, allowing the collar to fall open into a deep, plunging V-neckline.\n*   **Fit details:** The fabric exhibits tension wrinkles radiating horizontally from the button closures across the chest and waist, indicating a very tight fit.\n*   **Sleeves:** The sleeves are long and fitted, ending in standard cuffs, partially visible at the lower edges of the frame.\n\n**Lower Body: Waistband and Accessories**\nAt the waist, the shirt is tucked into a lower garment, of which only the upper waistband is visible.\n\n*   **Material:** This section is jet black with a smooth, possibly semi-matte leather or structured synthetic texture.\n*   **Construction:** It features a high-waisted cut with visible belt loops.\n*   **Accessory:** A matching black belt is threaded through the loops. It appears to be made of a smooth material similar to the waistband, lying flat against the garment without distinct texture or embellishment visible in this section.. White background, mannequin or flat lay, high detail.",
