  "prompt": "**Outfit Description**\n\n**The Bikini Top:**\nA sophisticated, two-piece bikini set in a solid, soft monochromatic nude-beige or champagne hue. The top features structured triangle cups with distinct vertical center-seam stitching (darts) for shaping. The center gore connects with intricate gold-tone metal hardware, featuring a small clasp and a delicate, dangling chain-link charm. The side wings of the top exhibit a strappy, cut-out design with dual thin bands wrapping around the ribcage. The shoulder straps are thin, adjustable spaghetti straps attached to the apex of the cups via small gold rings.\n\n**The Bikini Bottom:**\nThe matching bottoms are a low-rise bikini cut made from the same smooth beige fabric. They feature asymmetrical hip detailing: the wearer's left hip is adorned with a large, polished gold O-ring connector joining the front and back panels. The wearer's right hip features a thin, functional side-tie string closure, with the loose ends hanging down, finished with subtle knotted tips. Visible, precise stitching lines the leg openings and waistband.\n\n**Material & Texture:**\nThe fabric appears to be a high-quality, premium swimwear blend (nylon/spandex or lycra) with a smooth, matte finish that catches the light with a very subtle, soft satin sheen. The material is opaque and fits tightly against the form.",
