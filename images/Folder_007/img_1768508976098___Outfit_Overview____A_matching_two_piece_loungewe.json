  "prompt": "**Outfit Overview:**\nA matching two-piece loungewear or sleepwear set in a solid, muted olive green or moss green color. The aesthetic is casual, intimate, and comfortable with a focus on form-fitting basics.\n\n**Top:**\n*   **Style:** A sleeveless, cropped tank top or bralette.\n*   **Neckline:** A scoop neckline that sits moderately low on the chest.\n*   **Straps:** Wide, non-adjustable shoulder straps (tank style) rather than thin spaghetti straps.\n*   **Design Details:** The central feature is a prominent vertical ruched seam running down the center front. This cinching creates a gathered, rippled texture across the bust area.\n*   **Fit:** Tightly fitted and cropped, ending just below the ribcage to expose the midriff.\n\n**Bottoms:**\n*   **Style:** High-waisted lounge shorts or \"boy short\" style underwear.\n*   **Fit:** Snug and body-contouring with a smooth finish against the skin.\n*   **Waist:** Features a seamless or hidden elastic waistband that sits at the natural waistline.\n\n**Material & Texture:**\n*   **Fabric:** Appears to be a soft, high-quality jersey knit, cotton-modal blend, or spandex blend.\n*   **Texture:** Smooth, matte finish with significant stretch capabilities, allowing the fabric to conform closely to the body's curves without appearing shiny or synthetic.\n\n**Additional Styling Elements:**\n*   Small, delicate pink flower petals are scattered across the chest and adhered to the fabric of the top, acting as a decorative, ephemeral accessory.",
