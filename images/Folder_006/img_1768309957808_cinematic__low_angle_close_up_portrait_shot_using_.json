  "prompt": "cinematic, low-angle close-up portrait shot using an 85mm lens with a shallow depth of field, capturing a moment of contemplation in a dramatic selective color style. The entire image is rendered in high-contrast monochrome black and white, strictly isolating the vibrant, translucent amber-yellow lenses of the wire-frame aviator sunglasses as the sole element of color. The subject, featuring uploaded face as reference, is depicted with a thick, tousled hair that is heavily backlit, creating a brilliant rim-light halo effect against the darker surroundings. He adopts a pensive pose, with one hand raised, fingers gently grazing the chin, while looking off-camera to the upper left. The lighting is high-key background illumination with large, circular, blown-out bokeh orbs suggesting stage or stadium lights, while the foreground remains sharp and detailed. The clothing is a textured, dark button-up jacket with visible seams and fabric weave, rendered in grayscale. The image features 8k resolution, photorealistic skin textures, subsurface scattering on the hand, and a filmic grain structure typical of high-end event photography.",
