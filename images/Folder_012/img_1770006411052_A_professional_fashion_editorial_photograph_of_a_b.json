  "prompt": "A professional fashion editorial photograph of a beautiful young woman with blonde hair and fair skin, sitting on a neutral minimalist bench. She is wearing an elaborate, avant-garde outfit composed entirely of repurposed denim. The ensemble features a strapless denim corset top with brass buttons and white ornamental embroidery on the chest, paired with a denim shirt-collar choker layered over a pearl necklace. Around her waist are wrapped orange and purple fabric sashes. She wears long, layered arm warmers, including one with a mustard-yellow sleeve underneath denim gloves crafted from recycled jeans material. Her lower half consists of a heavily distressed denim mini-skirt with frayed edges and large rips, complemented by thigh-high denim leg warmers that mimic the construction of jeans. The background is a plain, neutral grey studio wall. The lighting is soft and directional, emphasizing the rich textures of the denim fabric and her delicate facial features. Sharp focus, high resolution, photorealistic, 8k, cinematic lighting, masterpiece.",
