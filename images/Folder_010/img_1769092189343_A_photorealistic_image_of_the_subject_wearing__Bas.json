  "prompt": "A photorealistic image of the subject wearing: Based on the image provided, here is a detailed description of the clothing and accessories:\n\n**Upper Body**\n*   **Garment:** A crisp, bright white button-down shirt.\n*   **Material:** The fabric appears to be a high-quality woven cotton or cotton-poplin blend. It possesses a smooth, matte finish but shows distinct, sharp creasing around the waist and sleeves, indicating a structured, non-stretch, or starched textile.\n*   **Style & Fit:** The shirt features a classic pointed collar that retains a sharp shape. It is tailored with a tight, body-con style, utilizing vertical darting or princess seams along the torso to contour closely to the shape. The sleeves are long and appear slightly cuffed or gathered at the wrist.\n*   **Styling:** The shirt is worn with the top several buttons unfastened, creating a deep, plunging V-shaped neckline that extends to the mid-torso. The remaining buttons are fastened tightly, creating tension lines in the fabric across the midsection. The buttons themselves are small, round, and white, likely plastic or mother-of-pearl.\n\n**Waist & Accessories**\n*   **Belt:** A medium-width black belt encircles the waist. It appears to be made of smooth leather or faux leather with a subtle sheen. It is devoid of heavy ornamentation, serving a functional and minimal aesthetic role.\n*   **Bottoms:** Only the uppermost waistband of the lower garment is visible. It is solid black, matching the belt, and made of a matte fabric, possibly a wool or synthetic blend trouser or skirt material. The white shirt is tucked neatly into this waistband.. The subject's identity and face must be perfectly preserved. Cinematic lighting.",
