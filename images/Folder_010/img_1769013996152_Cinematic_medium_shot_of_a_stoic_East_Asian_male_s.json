  "prompt": "Cinematic medium shot of a stoic East Asian male swordsman and a young East Asian woman standing together in a misty mountain forest, inspired by high-budget Wuxia historical cinema. The man appears middle-aged with a shaved head, strong square facial structure, sharp jawline, weathered realistic skin texture, cold and penetrating eyes filled with restrained intensity and quiet arrogance. He stands in a three-quarter angle with his body slightly turned away from the camera, gaze cast sideways with calm vigilance, hands resting firmly on the hilt of a sheathed sword with a wooden scabbard and fabric-wrapped grip.\n\nThe woman stands slightly behind and to the side of him, creating visual balance and narrative tension. She has delicate yet resilient features, calm but alert expression, soft natural skin texture, conveying quiet strength rather than fragility. Her posture is composed and grounded, subtly leaning into the shared presence without physical contact, suggesting trust and unspoken connection.\n\nBoth wear traditional coarse linen robes in muted grey and earthy tones, with visible fabric weave, layered garments, natural folds and creases shaped by long travel and wilderness exposure. The clothing appears practical, worn, and authentic rather than ornamental.\n\nThe environment is a vast mountainous forest with towering limestone karst peaks emerging through rolling seas of fog, inspired by Guilin and Zhangjiajie landscapes. Bamboo and forest foliage partially frame the foreground and midground, adding depth and natural layering. Volumetric mist fills the valleys, enhancing scale and atmosphere.\n\nWarm golden-hour light filters from behind and the side, creating soft rim lighting along their silhouettes while faces remain sculpted by gentle shadow. Natural earthy color palette, cinematic contrast, shallow depth of field, creamy bokeh, subtle film grain. Shot on Sony A7R IV with an 85mm f/1.4 lens, Kodak Portra 400 film aesthetic, ultra-detailed, photorealistic, cinematic masterpiece, 8K resolution.\n",
